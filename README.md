# AirlineTickets
Airline application

This application will help you find plane tickets. You can find your flight option by plane
with the exact date and location you need. And also you can choose the currency you need.

* This app finds the right tickets using the free aviasales API. (https://aviasales-api.herokuapp.com)
* The application helps you find the right tickets with the details of the place of flight and date. The data is obtained on request using a key token.
* Also in this application I use "promises" and "async" requests.
* All js components are created using classes
* The HTML elements used in the application are taken from the materialize library. Autocomplete in inputs as well as datepickers also from materialization
